UI:
Branch height: in pixels the height of the last branches. decrease when increasing tree depth or else it won't fit on the screen.
Branch width:  in pixels the width of the last branch. increase when increasing tree depth else won't be able to see little branches.
Twig rendering detail: approximation for the cone of the branch. also affects color of the twig.
Twig width gradient: how fast width decreases.

The values are changed better from keyboard then using the spinne controls.
